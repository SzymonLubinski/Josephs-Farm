# Joseph's Farm
I present the first game created by me. 
To create the game I used the python programming language, but I also spent a lot of time in the GIMP because I had to adapt the graphics to my game.

# Libraries
In the game I used libraries such as:
 - pygame
 - pygame zero
 - time and datatime
 - os
 - json

# File to downland
To play you need download and unzip the file Joseph's Farm.rar. Then start the game by clicking run_game.bat

# Game code
I am sharing my own game code. Only the pgzhelper.py file was downloaded from the internet from the website: https://www.aposteriori.com.sg/pygame-zero-helper/

It is very helpful to writing a game in pygame zero using pgzhelper as it solves many problems.

# Saying thank you
I am very grateful for the graphics that I used during my work. A special thanks to shubibubi for farm's graphics.
